title: My First Blog Post!
---

This first blog post serves as an example of more to come.
It is written in Markdown and converted to HTML by Jekyll.
One might wonder why I picked Markdown, and the answer is simple: I do not suspect I will need to apply HTML markup.
Everything I need is already available in Markdown, and it is a lot easier to write.

Let us try some things. How about a quote?
> This is a quote.

And let us see what a list looks like:

- List item 1
- List item 2
    - List item 3

1. List item 1
2. List item 2
    1. List item 3

Or code?

```python
def main():
    print("Hello World!")
```

And finally a table:

| Column 1 | Column 2 |
|----------|----------|
| Row 1    | Row 1    |
| Row 2    | Row 2    |

See you on the other site *side Markdown (was more aimed at myself, considering you are hopefully reading proper HTML at
the moment)!
